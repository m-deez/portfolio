        Welcome to Wondrous Creations: A D&D item creation app created by Matt DeZarn and brian kasten. We wanted to make an app for Dungeons & Dragons, 5th Edition, that would streamline the process of creating a new magic item, weapon, or armor and allow players to converse with one another about the items they made. This database is being stored on the Mongo DB cloud, better known as Atlas.
